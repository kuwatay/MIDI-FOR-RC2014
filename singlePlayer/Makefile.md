# Makefile ExplanationThis `Makefile` is designed to assemble `.asm` files into either `.hex` or `.txt` files, depending on the target system (SCM or CP/M). The assembler used is `sjasmplus`, and it provides rules for generating the appropriate file format for each system.### Variables- `ASM = sjasmplus`: This sets the assembler to `sjasmplus`, which is used to compile the `.asm` files.### Phony Targets- `.PHONY: clean`: Marks `clean` as a "phony" target, meaning it's not a file, but rather a command to clean up the directory.### Suffixes- `.SUFFIXES: .out .hex .asm .txt`: This specifies the file suffixes that will be used in the rules.### Main Target- `TARGET : nyancat.txt greens.txt nyancat.hex greens.hex`: The main target specifies that both `.txt` files (for CP/M) and `.hex` files (for SCM) will be generated for the `nyancat` and `greens` (likely "GreenSleeves") tracks.### Rule for SCM- `.asm.hex`: This rule generates `.hex` files from `.asm` files for the SCM system. The `sjasmplus` assembler is invoked with the `-DSCM=1` flag to generate a binary (`.bin`) file for SCM. The binary is then converted to a `.hex` file using `bin2hex`, starting at memory address `0x8000` with a 16-byte block size. This `.hex` file is suitable for pasting into the SCM console.  Example:  ```make  $(ASM) -DSCM=1 $< --lst=$(<:.asm=.scmlst) --raw=$(<:.asm=.bin)  bin2hex -o0x8000 -b16 $(<:.asm=.bin) > $@
